# Draw or Die
A small free time project to encourage me and my friends to draw more art, and keep it consistent! 

This concept of course has been done before by more skilled developers, a notable example being the DAD gallery. The point is, it's a project to help me get back into web development a bit before the brainrot consumes us fully.

## Concept
Do one artwork every day and upload it in time. A calendar view on your profile page keeps track of all your daily submissions. If you don't submit an artwork within the 24 hour timeframe given, you lose your streak and have to start over.
You may enter a small description about medium, time taken, and the art in general on a submission. Additionally, it's possible to view other people's profiles and leave comments.

I will try to keep functionalities and interfaces as minimal as possible in this project, and go with a less is more approach, rather than trying to add more cool functions. Simplicity above all else in this case, as the system should be as accessable and straightforward as possible.

Down below some rough sketches I made in preparation for this project. They are a bit low quality, but I'll fix this later on.

I am planning on deploying this system someday.

## Contact
I don't think anyone else is interested in this project for now, but I'll leave [my mail](mailto:anoukmartinezw@gmail.com?subject=[DoD%20Inquiry]) as always, just in case.

I'll work on this whenever I have some free time to spare (rare) and no games on my immediate backlog (rarer). But I'll still work on it ocasionally. The drive to create is eternally insatiable after all, even if it sometimes takes a little to return.
